for getting 3d tools
   there will be a arrow in the bottom and selcted 3D modelling
   near setting like thing
   
   
for viewing z axis
  change it into SE isometric
   
for shifting origin
  press ucsicon and no origin
  
  
  for getting a 3d
     draw 2d in xy axis and give it a thickness in z axis
     once done make sure it is close
     use press pull to create 3d
     
     
  the things will be shown in 2d wire frame in order to avoid them change them into soli
  make sure to turnoff grid if we don't want it
  
  incase if we are gonna draw anything it may have 2d frame in it
     to remove the 2d frame use cross window and and remove the stuff needed to removed
     
  use copy edges to draw any cirle with reference to edge
  select the edge , enter and dreaw mouse over a specified point and give the length
  
  
if we feel dynamic ucs is a trouble remove tht

click on multiple to select remaining portions
shift + middle mouse btn + drag for viewing stuffs

use move tool specify two source and ending point and place where ever needed
use enter its a good practice

use join tool to make the solid as a single object


use ucs accordingle on which part you are working on
top , left, bottom, right. so  on

we can give our desired color by double clicking on it


use extrude faces to gove color to the selected items
use free orbit to rotate in any direction
